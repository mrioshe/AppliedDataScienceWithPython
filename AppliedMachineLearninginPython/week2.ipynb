    "- Both classification and regression take a set of training instances and learn a mapping to a target value\n",
    "- For classification, the target value is a discrete class value\n",
    "    - Binary: target value is 0 (negative class) or 1 (positive class)\n",

    "    - Multi-label: There are multiple target values (labels)\n",
    "- For regression, the target value is continuous (floating point/real-valued)\n",
    "- Looking at the target value's type will guide you on what supervised learning method to use.\n",

    "    - K-nearest neighbors\n",
    "    - Linear model fit using least-squares\n",
    "- K-nearest neighbors makes few assumptions about the structure of the data and gives potentially accuarate but sometimes unstable predictions (sensitive to small changes in the training data)\n",
    "- Linear models make strong assumptions about the structure of the data and give stable but potentially inaccuarate predictions\n",
    "- Generalization ability: Refers to an algothm's ability to give accuarate predictions for new, previously unseen data.\n",
    "- Assumptions:\n",
    "    - Future unseed data (test set) will have the same properties as the current training sets.\n",
    "    - Thus, models that are accurate on the training set are expected to be accurate on the test set.\n",
    "    - But that may no happen if the trained model is tuned too specifically to the training set\n",
    "- Models that are too complex for the amount of training data avaible are said *overfit* and are not likely to generalize well to new examples.\n",
    "- Models that are too simple, that don't even do well on the training data, are said to *underfit* and also not likely to generalize well"
